# Are you wondering when you will be able to see the ISS for the next time?
Don't wait anymore and check for the answer thanks to this repository!

## What do I need to use this script?
You will need the [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org/) Wrapper developped and maintained by Petrus Hyv√∂nen who works for the [Swedish Space Corporation](https://www.sscspace.com/) and that you can find [here!](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit-labs/python-wrapper).

Please follow the instructions described in this wiki [here!](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit-labs/python-wrapper/-/wikis/installation) before using this script (I would recommend you to use the conda packages as it is way easier!)
